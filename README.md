   - An overview of the technologies that will be utilized throughout the project:
     - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the back-end.
     - **Express.js**: Web framework for building the back-end API.
     - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store application data.
     - **React (MUI)**: Front-end framework using React with Material-UI for UI components.

### 3. **Version Control**

## Milestone 2: Front-End Development - Login Page

In this milestone, we focused on building the front-end login page using React and Tailwind CSS. Key activities included:

### 1. **Login Page Creation**
   - We designed and implemented a user login page.
   - Integrated **React** for front-end logic and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

### 2. **Understanding Tailwind CSS**
   - Learned about the utility-first approach of **Tailwind CSS** and how it differs from traditional CSS.
   - Practiced using Tailwind's utility classes to style elements efficiently.

### 3. **Connecting to App**
   - Linked the login page to the main `App.jsx` file by creating a `LoginPage.jsx` component in the `pages` folder.

## Milestone 3: Back-End Setup - Node.js & MongoDB

In this milestone, we focused on setting up the back-end of the application. Key activities included:

### 1. **Folder Structure & Organization**
   - Organized the back-end code into dedicated folders for models, controllers, routes, and middleware to ensure scalability.

### 2. **Node.js Server Setup**
   - Initialized a **Node.js** server and created a `server.js` file to handle API requests.

### 3. **MongoDB Integration**
   - Connected the application to **MongoDB**, setting up the database for storing data related to products, users, and orders.

### 4. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented basic **error handling** to ensure the application responds appropriately to failed requests and server errors.
